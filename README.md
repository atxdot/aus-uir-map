# aus-uir-map

This application is meant for simple overlay analysis to view AUS district Utility Installation Review (UIR) data compared to current projects from the TxDOT Project Tracker hosted feature layer. District UIR data is updated weekly, along with the Project Tracker data. 

Built with the ESRI JavaScript API v3.21 and [Calcite Maps](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-maps). Developed for both visualizing
and editing/updating the ArcGIS Online hosted TxDOT Austin District storm water pond inventory feature service.
